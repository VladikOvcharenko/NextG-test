        <p class="about-box__text text">
          The N95 mask is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the
          nose and mouth to help minimise the chance of inhaling airborne
          particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask made
          from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised process
          called melt blowing. During this process, the inner layer of the N95
          mask is created which forms the filtration layer capable of filtering
          out at least 95% of airborne particles when worn correctly.
          <br /><br />During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during
          periods of intense air pollution, wearing N95 masks has been shown to
          help reduce the inhalation of compromised air, filtering out nasty
          pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing
          respiratory problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration is
          vitally important for remaining fit and healthy and people with
          pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly
          benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in public and
          unable to control the breathing environments that they find themselves
          in.

          N95 Respirators In Industrial And Health Care Settings
        </h2>
        <p class="about-box__text text">
          Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction and
          other industrial type jobs that expose workers to dust and small
          particles. They are regulated by the National Personal Protective
          Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for
          Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which is part of the Centers
          for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). <br /><br />However, some
          N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care setting.
          Specifically, single-use, disposable respiratory protective devices
          used and worn by health care personnel during procedures to protect
          both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer of
          microorganisms, body fluids, and particulate material. These surgical
          N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA, under 21
          CFR 878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
